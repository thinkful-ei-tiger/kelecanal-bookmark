Bookmark App!
Designed using JQuery, HTML, and CSS

As a user you should be able to:

- Add bookmarks to list

  - Bookmarks should contain:
    - title
    - url link
    - rating (1-5)
    - description

- Bookmarks should render when the page is first loaded.
  - Bookmarks should render in a 'condensed' view, meaning that they should expand when they are clicked on.
  - Bookmarks should be removable
  - URL and Title are required fields. If not input, they should throw an error.
  - Rating should be a drop down + submit.
